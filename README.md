# **Raft Consensus Implementation**:rowboat:

Consensus indicates that several servers agree on the same information, which is required for designing **fault-tolerant distributed systems**. 
Consensus algorithms enable a group of computers to function as a coherent entity that can withstand the failures of some of its members.
**RAFT protocol helps in achieving consensus.

In this project I implemented the two major task involved in RAFT algorithms
* **Leader Election**
* **Safe Log Replication**

## Leader Election
As per RAFT algorithm each node in a cluster can exist in three states, namely **Leader, Candidate and Follower**.
The below flow diagram explains the transition of nodes into different states.

For implementing succesful Leader Election, I incorporated below mentioned mechanism on each node

* Heartbeats
* ElectionTimeout
* AppendRPC
* RquestRPC

## Safe Log Replication
Implemented Safe Log Replication along with modified Leader Election algorithm to ensure only a candidate with complete log must get 
elected as leader. The below flow diagram explains the log replication process.

</p>

Implementing of safe log replication involves implementation of following mechanism
* **Leader Completeness** - Candidates with incomplete logs must not be elected as leader.
* **Log replications** to all the followers by the leader.
* **Log ordering** - Ensure the integrity of log.
* **Log inconsistencies** - Managing Follower's log with conflicting log entries or incomplete log entries.

## Tools and Technologies
* **Java**
* **Java Spring**
* **Multithreading in Java**
* **UDP Datagram Packets** - Used UDP packets for sending heartbeats, vote requests and other messages
* **Docker** - Built 5 container to simulate algorithm
